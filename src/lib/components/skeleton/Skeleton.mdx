# Skeleton

A Skeleton component is a placeholder or loading animation used in web and software applications to indicate that content is being loaded. It typically appears as a simplified, wireframe-like representation of the actual content, often in the form of boxes or lines. Skeleton components improve user experience by providing a visual cue that something is loading, reducing perceived wait times, and creating a smoother user interface. They are particularly useful for optimizing the user experience during content retrieval.
