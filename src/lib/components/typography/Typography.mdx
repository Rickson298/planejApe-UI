# Typography

A Typography component is a foundational element of web and software design that defines the visual style and formatting of text within an application. It encompasses various text properties, such as font styles, sizes, line spacing, and colors. Typography components are crucial for creating a consistent and aesthetically pleasing user interface by ensuring that text elements are clear, readable, and visually coherent. They play a significant role in establishing the overall look and feel of an application and contribute to a better user experience by enhancing readability and conveying information effectively.
