# Switch

A Switch component is a user interface element used in web and software applications to toggle between two states, typically "on" and "off" or "enabled" and "disabled." It is often represented as a sliding or toggling button. Switch components are used to allow users to change a binary setting or make a selection between two options. They enhance user interaction and provide a clear and intuitive way to enable or disable features, preferences, or functions. Switches are commonly used in settings, checkboxes, and control panels.

### Import

```ts
import { Switch } from 'planejape-ui-svelte';
```

### Usage

You can use the `Switch` component following the next steps:

1. Create a const to have a current switch value

```html
<script>
	const isChecked = false;
</script>
```

2. Place the `Switch` component and bind `isChecked` property

```tsx
<Switch bind:isChecked />
```

### Disabled

You can render a disable `Switch` just passing a `disabled` property

```jsx
<Switch disabled label="Disabled" />
```

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Disabled} />

### Checked

You can render a checked switch by default, passing the `isChecked` property

```jsx
<Switch isChecked label="Active" />
```

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Checked} />

## Props

<Canvas of={SwitchStories.Default} />
<Controls />
