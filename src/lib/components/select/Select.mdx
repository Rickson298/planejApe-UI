# Select

A Select component is a basic user interface element commonly used in web and software applications. It provides users with a dropdown list of options from which they can choose one. Select components are often used in forms and other interactive elements, allowing users to make a single selection from multiple choices. They enhance user interaction and data input by presenting a compact and user-friendly way to choose from predefined options.
